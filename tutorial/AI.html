    <h3>Key Features & Support</h3>
    <p>The AI Assistant provides a variety of intelligent hints and recommendations, enhancing different aspects of application development. Below are the supported features and hints that the plugin offers:</p>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>Smart Code Completion</h4>
        <p>Boost productivity with AI-powered code completion, offering context-aware suggestions for completing code, renaming variables and methods, and improving log messages or comments.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Press Ctrl+Space or Ctrl+Alt+Space to see a list of relevant suggestions.</p>
        <em>Note: The Ctrl+Space or Ctrl+Alt+Space shortcuts are switchable and configurable via <strong>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Jeddict AI Assistant &gt; Inline Completion</strong> tab.</em></p>
        <img src="jeddict-ai/resource/0-SmartSuggestions.gif" alt="Smart Suggestions" class="feature-img" width="1200" />
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>Inline Hint</h4>
        <p>The "Inline Hint" feature allows developers to receive AI-generated suggestions directly within the code editor. 
            When you press Enter while editing a line of code, the AI Assistant will display an inline hint based on the context of the code you are working on. 
            This inline hint appears in the code editor itself, providing immediate assistance without disrupting your workflow.
        </p>
        <strong>To use this feature:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>While editing your source code, press Enter to invoke the AI Assistant's inline hint for the current line of code.</li>
            <li>The suggestion will be shown inline within the editor.</li>
            <li>Press Enter again to confirm the suggestion and integrate it into your code, or press any other key to cancel the operation and dismiss the hint. </li>
        </ul>
        This functionality enhances the coding experience by offering contextual recommendations that can improve code quality and efficiency without requiring you to navigate away from your current task.
        <img src="jeddict-ai/resource/0-InlineHints.gif" alt="Inline Hint" class="feature-img" width="800" />
    </div>
    
    <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>Providing Context to Inline Hint</h4>
        <p>By default, the Inline Hint feature uses the existing code around the cursor as context to generate the next possible lines. 
            However, you can also provide custom input to guide the AI more effectively:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Use comments as hints:</strong> Write a comment in your source code describing what you want, then press Enter. The comment along with the current code will be used as context.
                <img src="jeddict-ai/resource/InlineComment.gif" alt="Inline Hint via Comment" class="feature-img" width="800" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Use saved prompts:</strong> You can define longer prompts in <em>Settings</em> and reuse them in the editor by typing <code>/${prompt-id}</code> and pressing Enter. The full saved prompt will be sent to the AI.
                <br/><img src="jeddict-ai/resource/InlinePrompt.gif" alt="Inline Hint via Prompt" class="feature-img" width="800" />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Extend saved prompts on the fly:</strong> Add more info inline using <code>/${prompt-id} your additional context</code>. The AI will process both the saved prompt and your added text.</li>
        </ul>
        These methods give you fine-grained control over the AI’s suggestions, helping tailor them to your current task more accurately.

        <p>The <strong>Directories and Files to Exclude from Context</strong> setting allows you to specify specific directories or files that the AI assistant should ignore during its analysis. This is particularly useful to enhance performance and accuracy by concentrating on the most relevant sections of your codebase.</p>
        <p>This setting is applicable at the Project Level within the AI Chat. To optimize results, please list the directories and files you wish to exclude, ensuring that the AI assistant focuses on the most pertinent data for your project.</p>

        <h4>Chat window placement</h4> 
        <p>
            You may also configure the chat window placement using the <strong>Default AI Assistant Placement</strong> option. 
            This allows you to choose whether the AI chat interface appears on the <strong>left</strong>, <strong>center</strong>, or <strong>right</strong>
            of the IDE window, based on your personal layout preference for better accessibility and workflow efficiency.

        <h4>Excluding Javadoc Comments</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Exclude Javadoc Comments in Context</strong> feature empowers the AI Assistant to disregard Javadoc comments during its analysis of the code. This capability helps to optimize token usage, thereby enhancing both performance and accuracy. By avoiding unnecessary input from Javadoc comments, the AI Assistant can focus more effectively on the substantive elements of the code, leading to more relevant and precise suggestions while maintaining clarity and efficiency in the recommendations provided.</p>

        <h4>Code Context Analysis (Default)</h4>
        <p>In the settings, configure the Context Scope to define the range of classes the AI Assistant will analyze. Options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Class</strong>: Focus on the current class being analyzed.</li>
            <li><strong>Referenced Classes</strong>: Include all classes referenced from the current class.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Package</strong>: Examine all classes within the current package, as well as those referenced by the current class.</li>

        <h4>Code Context Analysis for Variable Name, Method Name, String Literals</h4>
        <p>Configure the Context Scope specifically for naming variables, methods, or generating string/text blocks, as these typically do not require a large context scope. Options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Current Class</strong>: Focus on the current class being analyzed.</li>
            <li><strong>Referenced Classes</strong>: Include all classes referenced from the current class.</li>
            <li><strong>Current Package</strong>: Examine all classes within the current package, as well as those referenced by the current class.</li>
