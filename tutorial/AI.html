    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>The plugin supports configurable AI models and keys, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate their OpenAI accounts. The plugin searches for the API key and model in both environment variables and system properties, ensuring flexibility in how the integration is managed.</p>
    <p>Here are the supported configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"OPENAI_API_KEY"</strong> environment variable to set the OpenAI API key.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, <strong>"openai.api.key"</strong> system property to set the OpenAI API key.</li>
        <li><strong>"OPENAI_MODEL"</strong> environment variable to set the OpenAI model.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, <strong>"openai.model"</strong> system property also allows setting the OpenAI model.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the OpenAI API key is not explicitly configured via environment variables or system properties, the plugin will first check the user preferences for previously stored values. If the API key is still not found, the plugin will prompt the user to enter the API key manually through an input dialog. The entered API key will be saved in preferences for future use, ensuring a seamless experience during subsequent sessions.</p>
    <p>By default, if no specific model is configured via environment variables or system properties, the plugin will use the <strong>gpt-4o-mini</strong> model as a fallback, ensuring that the functionality remains available even without explicit user configuration.</p>
